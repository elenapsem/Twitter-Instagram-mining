For the collection analyzation of the content from Twitter and Instagram we used their API. More specifically, for the Twitter Api, a Twitter account were created and then a developer account were requested. The consumer Api keys, access token and access token secret were used for the data collection. For the Instagram data collection, Instaloader python module were used. The Data collection is consisting of about 100K tweets and instagram posts which contain the hashtag #stay_home and are written in english language. All these posts are stored within a mongo database.
	Using python library tweepy and the api that twitter offers, tweets along with some of their information were downloaded. Also using python library instaloader for academic and research purposes only, instagram posts containing the same fields with the tweets were downloaded too. Some fields of the posts are the text, the hashtags the date and time of the post, the likes received and their location. Also information about of the user of each post such as username and number of followers is also stored in database with each document.
The total dataset is consisting of 101464 posts and 76179 different users.
