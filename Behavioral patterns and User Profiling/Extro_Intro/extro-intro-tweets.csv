5ed04a4c682cbc70de4c4f2d,stevelwpalmer,@OvertonMarianne is there any information if Lincolnshire did this? https://t.co/ol6c58FIro
5ed04a4c682cbc70de4c4f2e,stevelwpalmer,This is not a real news conference. The Chief Medical Officer &amp; Chief Scientific Officer have either been gagged &amp;/or have told No 10 that they will not publicly back the PM’s defence of Dominic Cummings. Follow up questions have been stopped.
5ed04a4c682cbc70de4c4f2f,stevelwpalmer,Clap or no clap I will always be eternally grateful to the NHS. Very grateful also to the keyworkers in all walks of life during this crisis.
5ed04a4c682cbc70de4c4f30,stevelwpalmer,"@piersmorgan @MattHancock It’s very simple, it is embarrassing to see the number of “people” tested so it is easier to not show that figure. I did say before they stopped displaying it that is what will happen. Maybe I could be a government advisor, I fancy a castle sightseeing trip."

5ed04a4c682cbc70de4c4f32,stevelwpalmer,"@gavinesler @MrMirth It is not a good look. Censorship, gagging call it what you like people should be free to speak. Johnson is trying to say the Cummings issue is just politicking, trouble is politics is in every day life and this issue is dragging almost everyone in to the discussion, political no"
5ed04a4c682cbc70de4c4f33,stevelwpalmer,@BethRigby Very sorry to say but people are not behind the governments instructions now. PM says he will not throw away all we have gained. Time will tell.I will in the meantime be very cautious and hope others will but have my doubts as I watch strangers with wine obviously going on visit.
5ed04a4c682cbc70de4c4f34,stevelwpalmer,@RhonddaBryant @Imogenlemon02 They could set up a spray mist of disinfectant to walk through. Maybe a disinfectant tray like in foot and mouth outbreaks? The mind boggles.
5ed04a4c682cbc70de4c4f35,stevelwpalmer,As I watch complete strangers walking past my house some with wine in their hands it is clear people have used their own “common sense” and decided that lockdown is done and visiting family and friends now no matter what the government says. They have lost the people in this.
